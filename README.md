# 🛒 Oracle APEX E-Commerce System  
### 🎓 Academic Project – Semester 5 (Database Module)  
Developed by **Yahia Sihame**

## 📌 Project Context

This project was developed during **Semester 5 (S5)** as part of the **Database Management Module**.

The main objective was not to build a visually advanced interface, but rather to design and implement a strong **database-driven backend system** using Oracle technologies.

The focus was placed on **PL/SQL programming, database architecture, and business logic implementation**.

## 🧠 Backend-Oriented Approach

This project emphasizes the “engine” of the application:

- Advanced **PL/SQL procedures and triggers**
- Strong **data integrity constraints**
- Optimized **relational schema design**
- Automated business logic at the database level
- Server-side validation and processing

The front-end uses the default **Oracle APEX Universal Theme**, mainly as a functional interface to test and interact with the backend logic.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Platform:** Oracle APEX  
- **Database:** Oracle Database (19c / 21c)  
- **Languages:** SQL & PL/SQL  
- **Concepts Applied:**  
  - DDL & DML  
  - Triggers  
  - Sequences  
  - Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Check)  
  - Relational Data Modeling  

---

## 🏗️ Database Design

The schema includes structured and normalized tables such as:

- Products  
- Categories  
- Customers  
- Orders  
- Order Details  

Special attention was given to:

- Preventing orphan records using foreign keys  
- Automating ID generation with sequences  
- Enforcing business rules through triggers
